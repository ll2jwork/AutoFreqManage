# NYC Mesh Frequency Management Tool Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for an automated frequency management tool for NYC Mesh. The tool will help prevent frequency interference issues by automatically generating frequency charts, visualizing potential interference, and integrating with UISP to pull current frequency data.
