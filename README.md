# AutoFreqManage
Automated Frequency Management Tool that generates frequency charts

This will automatically generate frequency charts and include:
- Geographical positioning of sectors in the tool to better visualize potential interference
- Integrate with UISP to automatically pull current frequency data rather than manual entry
- Add visualization of sector coverage patterns to identify potential overlap areas

This will help prevent frequency interference issues in the future.
